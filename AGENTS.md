# Voxii Desktop - Agent Notes

This repo uses a **spec-only PRD** and a separate set of **working docs** for execution tracking.

## Where to log work

- PRD (spec only): [docs/PRD.md](docs/PRD.md)
- Working progress: [docs/working/PROGRESS.md](docs/working/PROGRESS.md)
- Task tracking: [docs/working/TASKS.md](docs/working/TASKS.md)
- Decision log: [docs/working/DECISIONS.md](docs/working/DECISIONS.md)
- Learnings: [docs/working/LEARNINGS.md](docs/working/LEARNINGS.md)
- Session notes: [docs/working/sessions/](docs/working/sessions/)

## Rules of engagement

- Keep changes scoped to **voxii-desktop** unless explicitly asked.
- Update **TASKS / DECISIONS / session notes** as part of implementation work.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits and clear markdown links (relative paths).
