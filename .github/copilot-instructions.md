# Copilot Instructions (voxii-desktop)

Follow the canonical guide in [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Non-negotiables

- Keep [../docs/PRD.md](../docs/PRD.md) spec-only (no TODOs or progress).
- Track execution in [../docs/working/](../docs/working/) (TASKS/PROGRESS/DECISIONS/LEARNINGS).
- When behavior changes, update the relevant working docs in the same change.
